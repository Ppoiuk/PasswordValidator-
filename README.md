# PasswordValidator-
This program checks the security strength of the passwords you enter and provides feedback for improvement. Passwords are evaluated based on length and whether they use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. If it contains repeated characters or sequential numbers, you'll see a warning message.
The execution of this code is pretty straightforward. Download or clone the current code and run it as a java file, then use the terminal to enter the desired password, and you should see the result.
This code is just for practice, so it may not be suitable as a real security code. Also, the password entered is not saved.
This program should only be used to help individuals improve their security. As open source software, it is free for anyone to use, but all users are expected to follow ethical principles.
